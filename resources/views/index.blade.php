        <div class="content-item">
            <h4>DaoCoin Services</h4>
            <div>The Platform is an online environment to purchase several cryptocurrencies backed by different fiat currencies（“the Tokens”）for the underlying fiat currencies and redeem the Tokens for the underlying fiat currencies only. The Tokens are not money, legal tender, and are not monetary instruments. They are also not stored value or currency. Once you have the Tokens you can trade them, keep them, use them to pay persons that will accept your Tokens, or redeem them for underlying fiat currency.<br>
                 Each Token is fully backed by the underlying fiat currency at issuance. Token holders can purchase or redeem the Token for the underlying fiat currency held in escrow accounts managed by our fiduciary network through the Platform. <br>
                 The Platform is intended only to facilitate such purchases and redemptions. The Company utilizes smart contracts and escrow accounts managed by professional trust companies in order to legally guarantee a 1 to 1 parity between each Token and the underlying fiat currency held in escrow accounts for the benefit of our users. The Company itself does not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of the Tokens for the underlying fiat currencies.<br>
                 The Company reserves the right to refuse to issue or redeem the Token, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any act, conduct, transaction, omission, or misrepresentation, or the party requesting the issuance or redemption, violates, attempts to violate, causes, aids, or abets the violation of any applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, or regulations; is suspected or believed to be blocked property, frozen assets, or economic resources, or the proceeds of any crime, terrorist financing, or corruption related to any person or government official under any applicable laws; exposes the Company to sanctions, restrictions, or penalties. The Company also reserves the right to refuse to issue or redeem the Token upon receipt of any subpoena, order, or request from any government, government official, or law enforcement authority of competent jurisdiction.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-item">
            <h4>No Class Proceedings</h4>
            <div>You and we agree that any party hereto may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless the parties agree otherwise, any adjudicator of any claim—whether judicial or otherwise—may not consolidate or join more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Any adjudicator of any claim may award relief, including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, only in favor of the party seeking relief, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other users of the Platform or of any Services.

        <div class="content-item">
            <h4>Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing</h4>
            <div>We are committed to providing you with safe, compliant, and reputable services through the Platform. Accordingly, we insist on a comprehensive and thorough customer due diligence process and implementation and ongoing analysis and reporting. This includes monitoring of and for suspicious transactions and mandatory reporting to international regulators.<br>
                 We reserve the right to refuse registration to, or to bar transactions from or to, anyone from or in jurisdictions that do not meet international AML–CTF standards as set out by the FATF; to anyone that is a Politically Exposed Person within the meaning of the FATF’s 40 Recommendations; or that fails to meet any of our customer due diligence standards, requests, or requirements. In lieu of refusing registration, we may perform enhanced customer due diligence procedures. At all times, you may be subject to enhanced customer due diligence procedures in your use of the Platform and any related service.<br>
                 We reserve the right to prohibit specific cryptocurrency wallet addresses from accessing the Platform, receiving the Tokens, or transferring the Tokens if properly directed to do so by law enforcement or a court of competent jurisdiction. The Company will cooperate with applicable law enforcement and regulatory authorities where it is required to do so and will share information if there are grounds to believe that the Token is being used for illegal purposes.<br>
                 We reserve the right to prohibit specific cryptocurrency exchanges from accessing the Platform, receiving the Tokens, or transferring the Tokens if the exchange has not been preapproved by the Company or the Company is properly directed to do so by law enforcement or a court of competent jurisdiction. <br>
                 We reserve the right to restrict or prohibit the listing or trading of the Tokens on any exchange in our sole and absolute discretion. Any exchange that lists any Token represents and warrants to the Company that by doing so it is duly organized, registered, licensed, and shall comply with all applicable laws and rules in every jurisdiction in which it operates. <br>
                 Furthermore, any exchange listing any Token represents and warrants to the Company that by doing so it has Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") and Counter Terrorist Financing controls meeting the requirements in every jurisdiction in which it operates. The Company will make reasonable efforts to notify and inform exchanges in advance of any such restriction or prohibition, unless the Company is prohibited from doing so by law or under an order from a court of competent jurisdiction or authority.

                 Should the ethereum blockchain fork, we reserve the right to select the new fork based on factors that include, but are not limited to, community adoption and long-term viability. In the event of an ethereum fork, the Tokens on the non-chosen fork will not be valid for any purpose and shall be frozen.
                 In order to cause the Token to be issued or redeemed by the Company, you must be a verified customer of the Company. You must create an account on the Platform and pass any bank verifications and KYC/ AML validation requirements that we or our fiduciary partners require.

            <h4>How We Collect Information From You</h4>
            <div>We collect information from you in two ways:<br>
                 First, we collect information directly from you when you provide it to us, such as signing up for an account, or entering information into the Platform when prompted or permitted through a series of questions provided to you on the Platform.<br>
                 Second, we collect generic information about your usage and equipment automatically as you navigate through the Platform, such as usage details, IP addresses, web browser preferences, and information collected through cookies and other tracking technologies. Although we do not correlate tracking information to individuals, some information collected, such as IP addresses, will be unique.</div>

        <div class="content-item">
            <h4>Do Not Track Settings</h4>
            <div>We do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-item">
            <h4>How We Use Your Information</h4>
            <div>From time to time, it is necessary for customers to supply us with data in connection with the opening or continuation of accounts, and the establishment or continuation of facilities or provision of services, or in compliance with any laws or guidelines issued by regulatory or other authorities. We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including personal information:<br>
                 To continue the daily operation of the services and facilities provided to customers.<br>
                 To meet the requirements to make disclosures under the requirements of any law binding on the Platform under and for the purposes of any guidelines issued by regulatory or other authorities with which the Platform is expected to comply.<br>
                 To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us.<br>

                 To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.<br>
                 To notify you about changes to the Platform or any products or services we offer or provide though it.<br>
                 In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-item">
            <h4>Disclosure of Your Information</h4>
            <div>We only collect personal information that we believe to be relevant and required to conduct our business. We may share your personal information with our business partners and service providers, but only to the extent that they each need to know specific information to continue to provide the Platform or services to you. This includes:<br>
                 Our contractors, employees, service providers, and other third parties that we use to support our business and improve the Platform;<br>
                 To our subsidiaries and affiliates;<br>
                 To our fiduciary and other financial partners to provide the Platform services to you;<br>
                 To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger or reorganization if the personal information of our users is part of the assets transferred;<br>
                 To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it;<br>
                 To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request;<br>
                 To third party contractors in order to analyze Platform performance and user behavior and/or to improve the Platform;<br>
                 If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Platform, our users, or others; or<br>
                 For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information. We may disclose aggregated information about our users, which means information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. As an example, we may include in our marketing materials that a certain percentage of our users are female, but we won't share a list of all female users in these materials.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-item">
            <h4>Accessing and Correcting Your Information</h4>
            <div>You can review and change your personal information by logging into the Platform and visiting your account page. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-item">
            <h4>Data Security</h4>
            <div>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access. For example, access by a user to his or her personal information is available through a unique customer ID and password selected by the user that should be regularly updated. This information is encrypted through the Platform with Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) and is also encrypted when it is stored by us to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. Also, we perform regular malware scanning of the Platform and all servers and computers used by us to support the Platform. All Company employees are required to adhere to our security and confidentiality procedures and undergo training related to maintaining the security of user personal information. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have chosen a password for access to certain parts of the Platform, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone and be careful about giving out information to other users on the Platform if requested. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Platform. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Platform.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-item">
            <h4>Third Party Links</h4>
            <div>The Platform may contain links that lead to other websites, and the Company is not responsible for the privacy practices, content, and/or activities of these linked websites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the Platform and welcome any feedback about these external websites.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-item">
            <h4>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h4>
            <div>We will post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page and you will be notified of any material changes on the Platform home page and in an email to the most recent email address that you provided to us, if any.</div>
